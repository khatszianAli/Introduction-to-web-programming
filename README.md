# Introduction to web programming
This repository contains laboratory works and projects for the course Introduction to web programming.

The Web Programming course introduces students to the fundamentals of designing and developing web applications, covering both front-end and back-end technologies. It begins with an overview of how the web works, including client-server architecture and HTTP/HTTPS protocols, before delving into front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building responsive and interactive user interfaces. Students will then explore back-end development, including server-side programming, databases, and RESTful APIs, to create dynamic and data-driven web applications. The course also emphasizes modern web development tools, version control with Git, and best practices for security and performance optimization. Through hands-on projects, students will gain practical experience in building full-stack web applications.

#Learning Outcomes

-Understand core web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for creating static and interactive web pages.
-Design and implement server-side logic using languages like Python (Django/Flask), Node.js, or PHP, and manage server-client communication.
-Explore modern frameworks/libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to create dynamic user interfaces.
-Understand web accessibility (WCAG), responsive design, and SEO principles.
-Design and consume RESTful APIs or GraphQL for enabling interaction between web applications and external services.
-Use foundational knowledge of web application security, including protection against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.
-Use version control systems like Git for collaborative development.
-Work effectively in teams to develop, test, and debug web applications, practicing agile or similar development methodologies.
